# For-Recruiters-look-here:

Hi there,
thank you for taking the time to preview my repository. Two quick things I'd like to mention before you go in. I know you're busy so I'll keep this short:

 1. You can preview a hosted version for most of the websites. The hosted version link will be somewhere inside the MD for each project (and all links are at the bottom of this MD). Very usefull, specially if you have no coding background and you just want to see some suff in action 

 2. Some of these projects (specially the React ones) use minimum-css as their purpose to show off the coding logic and knoweldge, not to look pretty. Creating complicated functionality takes time, and these personal projects are done on my free time, so to save time I try not to focus too much on CSS/HTML structure if it wasn't important. :) For UI/UX interfaces, you're advised to check out my Website for professional work (link on my Resume). I'm not allowed to display professional projects on github per clients polices.


I won't keep you any longer, thank you for reading this far and have fun :)
